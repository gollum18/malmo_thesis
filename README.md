# malmo_thesis

This is intended to house all the files for my senior thesis on 3D path planning at Baldwin Wallace University conducted
from Fall 2017 to Spring 2018.

All Malmo mission XML file and text descriptors are stored in the src/mission folder.

Due to the way Project Malmo handles world state representations and agent interaction with it, the descriptors files
are necessary to dictate the parameters of the mission area to the RRT agent.
