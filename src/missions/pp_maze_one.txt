/*
    The parser will ignore classic C style block comments as well as
        single line comments.
    The parser will also ignore empty lines.
    The normal order for this is to parse in obstacles first and then walkable space.
        Each section is preceded by a number x | x >= 0 that indicates the number of obstacles and then walkable
            space.
